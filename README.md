# Hello there, I am Michal👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a software engineering student passionate about everything related to coding and computers. Although my github page looks rather empty, I am planning on opening some of my projects that I have in my private repositories soon, so come and check ⭐️

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **Siumly**
- 🌱 I’m confident in **Web development (Angular, NodeJs), Java, and Python**
- ⚡ I'm also learning **C#, C and React**
- 👋 Fun fact: **I don't actually hate web design 🖌️**
